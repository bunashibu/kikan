### What is kikan?

*kikan* is a 2D multiplayer online pvp game inspired from *The Legends Return*

### Why kikan was created?

Because we can't play *The Legends Return* anymore.

> On October 26th, 2016 *Star Planet* (which is MapleStory's minigame area) was closed. Accordingly, one of its minigame named *The Legends Return* has been unavailable.

### What are the differences from *The Legends Return*?

* Doesn't take damage when a player enters a portal
* Stage is symmetry in order to prevent area unfairness

### Development Environment
* Unity 2018.3.11f1
  + Photon Unity Networking (Classic v1.95)
  + UniRx
